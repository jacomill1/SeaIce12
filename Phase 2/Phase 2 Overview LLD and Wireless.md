## Phase 2 Objectives

Phase 2 of the SeaIce Creamery Network Project focuses on developing the Low Level Design (LLD), Wireless LAN implementation planning, and beginning the lab environment setup. This phase builds upon the foundations established in Phase 1's High Level Design.

### Key Deliverables

1. **Low Level Design (LLD) Documentation**
    - Layer 3 connectivity design and configuration details
    - Feature and technology specifications for all devices
    - Detailed traffic flow patterns through all network layers
    - Protocol implementation specifications
    - Code-level recommendations for all network appliances
2. **Wireless LAN Design**
    - Coverage planning and AP placement
    - Channel and power management strategy
    - SSID and security implementation plan
    - Integration with existing wired infrastructure
    - Controller redundancy and failover design
3. **Network Service Integration**
    - Interface definitions for DHCP, DNS, and Voice Gateway services
    - Detailed configuration for L2 adjacency between service clusters
    - IP addressing implementation for service VIPs
    - Service redundancy and failover mechanisms
4. **Finance Department Segregation**
    - Comprehensive security implementation via FSP
    - Detailed traffic flow documentation for Finance-specific traffic
    - Access control rule specifications
    - Monitoring and auditing configuration
5. **Lab Environment**
    - Working prototype of the network design
    - Validation of all design elements
    - Testing of failover and redundancy mechanisms
    - Proof-of-concept for critical security controls

## Timeline and Milestones

1. Week 1: Complete LLD documentation and network service integration plans
2. Week 2: Develop and present Wireless LAN design; begin lab environment setup
3. Week 3: Finalize lab implementation and validation testing; prepare for Phase 3

## Success Criteria

- Full approval of LLD by SIC stakeholders
- Successful demonstration of traffic flows in lab environment
- Complete documentation of all configuration details
- Validated redundancy and failover mechanisms
- Approved Wireless LAN design ready for Phase 3 implementation
- Detailed configuration templates prepared for all network devices

## Focus Areas for Design Defense

1. Traffic flow explanations across all network layers
2. Network services access methodology and redundancy
3. Internet circuit connectivity and failover mechanisms
4. Finance Department segregation and security controls
5. Overall redundancy implementation throughout the design
6. IP addressing scheme justification and future expansion strategy
7. Wireless integration with security considerations

This phase will establish the detailed blueprint for implementation, ensuring all technical requirements are fully specified before moving into the physical deployment in Phase 3.
